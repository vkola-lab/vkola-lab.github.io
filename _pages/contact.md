## Opportunities for Current or Admitted Students

If you are a <b>current student</b> or <b>already accepted</b> into an academic or medical

<b>We form small teams comprising individuals with complementary expertise and work persistently to build comprehensive solutions.</b>

An ideal candidate who wants to pursue a PhD in our lab is expected to have some background in computing and an interest in pursuing biomedical research.

An ideal MD student who wants to pursue research in our lab is willing to leverage their medical training and explore the nuances of  machine learning and computer vision.

Undergraduate and Masters students who want to pursue research in our lab should be willing to commit to work with us for at least <b>2 years,</b> if not more.

Please contact one of our <b>Postdoctoral Scholars</b> or <b>Graduate Students</b> from our <a href="https://vkola-lab.github.io/team/" >Team Page </a> to set up an appointment at one of these two locations:

## Postdoctoral Positions

For postdoctoral positions, please contact the PI directly.

## Prospective Students

We receive many inquiries from individuals at different stages of their academic journey, and we have limited capacity to engage with students who are <b>not yet admitted</b> to a graduate or professional program.

We are unable to offer research opportunities, mentorship, or individualized guidance to students who are currently in the process of applying to graduate school. Contacting the lab during your application process will not influence admissions outcomes, as the lab does not play a formal role in program admissions.

## Other Prospective Researchers

At this time, the lab is <b>not actively hiring</b>. However, in rare cases, we remain open to hearing from <b>exceptional candidates</b> whose background and goals strongly align with our research. If you believe your background and expertise make you a uniquely strong fit, please complete this [application form](https://forms.gle/9nFG4KkpSypELuoA9) to express your interest.

Please note that due to the high volume of inquiries, we will only contact applicants who are a strong match for our current research needs. If you do not hear from us, we encourage you to continue exploring opportunities and wish you the best in your academic and research pursuits.
