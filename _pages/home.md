We are a highly interdisciplinary research group, bringing together trainees and scientists from computer science, neuroscience, bioinformatics, physics, computing and data sciences, electrical and computer engineering, and medicine. We actively collaborate with clinicians and domain experts across diverse specialties and institutions globally. This unique convergence of disciplines has enabled us to publish across the full spectrum of scientific inquiry, from top-tier journals like *Nature Medicine* to premier computer science venues such as the *International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)*. **Our mission is to create methods to fit the science and not make science fit the methods.** Together, we are advancing impactful science at the intersection of **AI and human health**.

### Joining our laboratory
We form small teams comprising individuals with complementary expertise and work persistently to build comprehensive solutions. 

**Important:** Please read the <a href="https://vkola-lab.github.io/contact/" >Contact Us Page </a> to learn about open positions.
